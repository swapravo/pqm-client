version 0.1

Suite of Post Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms supported:

Asymmetric Key: MCEQCMDPC256FO-CUBE512-CHACHA20
Digital Signatures: FMTSEQ256C-CUBE512-CUBE256
Symmetric key + Authenticated encryption: CHACHA20,XSYND,ARCFOUR,CUBE512,SHA512


CONSTANTS:

byteorder = little

Size of the encrypted nonce sent by the server for authenticating users: 64 bytes
Max length of an email ID: 128 characters

# commands to server are shortened to 2 bytes

	refer to 'commands' for the complete set of commands defined

Server Request Size: 2 bytes ( => 65536 different requests)

EXTENSIONS TO IDENTIFY A KEY:

This naming convention shall be used throughout the program to uniquely identify a key.

encryption public key: .qepk
encryption secret key: .qesk
signature public key: .qspk
signature secret key: .qssk

Symmetric keys don't have a naming convention as of now

NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR A KEY: username.type


Structure of an email:

timestamp -> 24 bytes
message_length -> 5 bytes => max email size = 8GiB


#To be included:
Message Numbers
chmod going necessary files and directories to prevent access
Function to check for and download updates
