# [Post Quantum Mail](https://www.postquantummail.com)
## Bracing for impact

### We are pre/alpha right now!
##### **It will probably crash and burn if you try to run it!**


### [Core ideas and Features](https://postquantummail.com/features.html):

* End-to-End encrypted mails (**including** subjects and attachments)
  * With quantum-safe encryption algorithms[*](https://postquantummail.com/security.html) and signature schemes.
  * All we can ever see	is the sender's and reciepient's address.

* Sick of advertisements? We are too. So, no advertisements for you!

* No foreceful collection of personal information:
  * No phone numbers, *unless you want* to opt for 2FA.
  * No linking you to other addresses, disguised in the form of "recovery mail addresses", *unless you want it.*

* Free for personal use.
  * Upgrade only for "out-of-the-box" or corporate use cases.

* Your keys are generated on your device and the secret keys **never** leave it.

* Verifiable trust policy: Just because you use our services does **not** mean you have to trust *us*.
	* Cryptographically-signed mails.
	* Open source applications for you to tinker with.

* **Both** GUI and CLI interfaces!

* Store more mails with the same storage capacity with us.
    * Your mails are compressed before they are encrypted
    * And yes, we know about [CRIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME).

### Technicals

We advise you to, and would really appreciate it, if you check out the technicals.

* Currently, we use [CodeCrypt](https://github.com/exaexa/codecrypt) as the quantum-safe cryptographic backend and we plan to port it to [LibOQS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) when it comes of age.
